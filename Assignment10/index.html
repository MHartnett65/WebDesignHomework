    <h1>The Epic Saga of Gears of War</h1>
    <p>Before this description. I wanted to get personal and let you know why I chose this topic
        This game means the absoulte world to me because it was the game I grew up playing with my best friend Jackson.
        He unforunately passed away from a completed suicide so I always try to include this game in a lot of the things I do.
        He is the reason I am in the field of suicide prevention and the reason I want to learn about game design. I want to design games like this that inspire memories
        Thank you for reading and I hope even if it is a small assignment I am able to give you a peak behind the computer screen we do during this online class.
