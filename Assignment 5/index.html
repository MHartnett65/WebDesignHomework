            Dan Abnett is a sci-fi comic book and novel author. You may recognize him from popular franchises Dr. Who, Marvel, and other. I know him from the Warhammer 40k
            book series. He has written a ton for the black library and the reason he is one of my favorites. Is he has such an attention to detail and a way to generate character
            backgrounds without drowning the audience in flash back moments. His pace in the story leaves a nice flow as well as a way to not throw off his audiences.

         My top 3 favorite books of his are.
         1. First and only book 1 of Gaunts ghosts.
         2. Horus Rising.
         3. Eisenhorn Xenos.
