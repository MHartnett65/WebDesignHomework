    <h1>The Importance of the Medicine Wheel</h1>
    <p>Before diving into this subject I wanted to put a disclaimer on this cultural learning. One thing people need to realize is all tribes have different way of doing things.
        The medicine wheel means different things for different tribes. This is my understanding growing up as a proud Assiniboine. Some tribes use different meanings, colors, and even the shape of their wheel.
        I showed one example of this from the photo I chose from the orginizaiton I work for call the Helena Indian Alliance. We feature green instead of black. Because in some tribes black represents a color of death and despair.
        Where how I was raised black does not have that meaning to my tribe. So even though I am sharing a lot of cultural knowledge remember. Always ask the same question to different native people because it can mean different things depedning on the tribe.
        Thank you for letting me share my culture and I hope you were able to learn something!

    <p>The Medicine Wheel is a sacred symbol used by many Native American cultures, particularly those of the Plains tribes. It represents the interconnectedness of all things and serves as a guide for living a balanced and harmonious life. 
        It is also a belief in how I was taught is it represents all the knowledge on mother earth. We strive to learn and become better from the gifts of mother earth.

    <p>The four quadrants of the Medicine Wheel symbolize various aspects of existence:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The East represents the beginning, birth, and heart.</li>
        <li>The South represents growth, youth, and soul.</li>
        <li>The West represents adulthood, introspection, and body.</li>
        <li>The North represents wisdom, elderhood, completion, and Mind.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, the Medicine Wheel embodies the interconnectedness of all living beings and the natural world. It teaches respect for all life forms and encourages harmony with nature.</p>
